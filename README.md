# BI-PA2
This is my programs in C++ from 2019/20 PA2 course from my school. It's not documented sorry 😕 but it could help someone who wants to have some inspiration for solving PA2 homeworks.

## I hope it will help others to succesfully complete this subject. 💚

Disclaimer ❗ ❗
Progtest will check for duplicities even through old submissions and these are my submitted programs. So if you wanna copy some of this code be aware of this. Also these codes are publicly aviable so it's possible someone also copy some parts and increases your chance of your copy flag at end of the year. So please, use it only for inspiration how to solve issues but don't do ctrl+c,v it increases your chance to get copy flag. 🚩
